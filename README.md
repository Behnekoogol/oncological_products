# oncological_products-


Company X distributes oncological products, and our sales force team promotes several key products.
We recently launched a new product. For the evaluation of the market performance, we use
prescription data on the INN SubstanzXYZ. There are currently 18 competitors on the German
market. Our sales force consists of 10 territories.
Attached you find two data sets:
• Monthly prescription data both on volume and sales 
◦ for 18 manufacturers
◦ on segment level

• Mapping for territory structure based on segments
Please outline your approach to how you would prepare and analyse the data to address aspects
including the following:

• Overview on market size
• Market share development (volume and value) on national level
• Analysis for each territory
• Highlight differences on market performance across territories
• Any other topics you think would be valuable to look at
